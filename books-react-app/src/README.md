I need to modernize the style of my React + TypeScript library management app. Please help me redesign the entire app with a modern, clean, and smart style that includes coherent colors and typography. The design must be fully responsive for mobile phones, tablets, and laptops, using media queries or responsive design techniques as needed. I want a modern look but not overly complex, with minimal boilerplate. You can choose between Tailwind CSS or Material UI as the best option for this project. Please generate the necessary SCSS, CSS, or component files with consistent styling throughout the app, ensuring responsiveness and simplicity.
